# RPSLS_React_Socket.io

ROCK - PAPER - SCISSORS - LIZZARD - SPOCK
I just want to learn how to use socket.io or how to "link" 2 different clients through the same server in order to play sth together.

For that Im gonna try to build the classical rock, paper, scissors, adding more complexity and also more visuals.

# TODO LIST:
1. Create server using cors and checking socket.io
··· Im gonna use express for simplicity (only 1 library instead of 4324 like koa) and I will use MongoDb to store game records, as win/tie/lose (running locally using mongoose)
2. Test the test using postman.
3. Create a simple client with 5 div/buttons that sends http request when pressed and get result or waits...
4. Add styles

# For anyone else interested:
Im learning how to create cool stuff and Im trying to make my little space in this awesome world of WebDev, in order to do it I like to challenge myself doing simple projects with a little twist to practice sth I never saw before, in this case Im getting into socket.io!

Wish me luck!!

Feel free to fork the repo or contact me if you want to participate/help I will be glad to hear new ideas and also help if I can.
